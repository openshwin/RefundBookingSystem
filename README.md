### 💡 How it all began



It all began ... with a delay 


Good ideas often arise out of the ambition to solve problems in a new manner.


The idea behind Refundmore occurred when Phillip, one of the founders, ex-girlfriend late in 2013 on a trip to Turkey was delayed for seven long hours. The delay ruined the entire first day of their holiday.


According to the EU-Regulations, she was entitled to compensation. Philip explored the options concerning compensation and realized how difficult it was to make the airline acknowledge their responsibility and pay out the compensation according to the law.


Phillip is definitely not the type who gives up easily. Therefore, he allied himself with his friend, Gustav, who at that time was studying law. Gustav brought the case to the authorities. He won the case and ensured that Philip’s girlfriend received the compensation she was entitled to.


After that episode, everything went fast - and the two friends, Philip and Gustav, received many inquiries from passengers, who also experienced that the airlines would not pay.


Today, Gustav is the CEO of Refundmore, and yes, the rest is history.


Since then, Refundmore has collected more than €40 million from the major airlines and transferred the money to our many customers.
